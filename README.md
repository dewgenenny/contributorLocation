# Contributor Location helps you find where a repositories contributors are from :) 

Simple python script to help you find where in the world a repositories contributors are from!

Takes the repo you want to review as an argument: 

```
python3 main.py docker/compose
```

It is dependent on the location that a github user stores in their profile, so the reliability of this is not super high...
